title: On the fragility of RSS
---

_[Protocols not platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)_ runs the mantra. And the most useful protocol (after HTML) is RSS, established in the previous millenium, last updated in 2009 and still going strong because it’s not owned by a company.

In one sense we’re living in a golden age of RSS – apps such as [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) and [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) have allowed us to funnel newsletters and even Twitter streams into our readers, quietly decoupling content from the platforms. Yet there’s been no groundswell of people moving from platforms to RSS, despite the dismal reputation of companies like Facebook, Medium and Twitter, and the apparent belief that spending a lot of time using these services is bad for one’s mental health.

Back in 2009 I would visit a website and be able to subscribe to its RSS feed – or even feeds. These days it’s not uncommon to vist sites which have no feed at all. I wonder if most site owners are even aware their sites have an RSS feed.
